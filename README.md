Intel OneAPI provides two interfaces for programming - OpenCL and DPC++/SYCL for CPUs and GPUs. TAU supports both - the OpenCL profiling interface and Intel Level Zero API to observe performance. 
* [TornadoVM](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM) - TornadoVM is an open-source software technology that automatically accelerates Java programs on multi-core CPUs GPUs and FPGAs.
* [toyBrot](https://gitlab.com/VileLasagna/toyBrot) - toyBrot is a raymarching fractal generator that is used both as a  simple benchmarking tool and a study tool for parallelisation. The code is is implemented with over 10 different technologies including Intel TBB ISPC and SYCL (with support for oneAPI)
* [XFluids](https://github.com/XFluids/XFluids) - a unified cross-architecture heterogeneous CFD solver that suports Nvidia, Amd and Intel GPUs.
* [ZFP](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) - zfp is a compressed format for representing multidimensional floating-point and integer arrays. zfp provides compressed-array classes that support high throughput read and write random access to individual array elements. zfp also supports serial and parallel compression of whole arrays for applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk.
